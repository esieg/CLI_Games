# Pong for 2Players
Let play us pong, player vs Player

## Compile
I use simple g++ for compiling and add the ncurses-Header
> g++ -std=c++17 -o Pong Pong.cpp -lncurses

## Start the game
Use this in the folder containing the Pong-Binary (Terminal should have at least 42x42 [columnsxrows])
> ./Pong
